There's a voice inside your head
Makes you alive makes you mad
All the wisemen looked for
Understand her and her love

Most of them died in a madhouse
Pushed in by those who knows
How to act how to perform.
Are you alive or just a corpse?

Take a breath find yourself
I will give you all my meds
Free your mind feel the Beast
Just one step into the mist
