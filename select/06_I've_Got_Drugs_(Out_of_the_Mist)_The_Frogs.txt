I've done drugs that would blow your mind
Tonight real fine
Tonight blow your mind
Tonight out of my mind
Tonight
Tonight goin' out of my mind

Tonight out of my mind
Tonight blow you blind
Tonight

I've got a suitcase full of drugs I can turn you on
Would you like to come along?
(I'd like to come along)
I've got got drugs (where ya goin' man?)
I've got drugs (can I come wherever it is man?)
I've got drugs (I'll do your dope)
I've got blues (I'll be a dope man)

Out of the mist, there's a pimp (out of the misty moon)
Out of the mist, there's a hooker (coppin' tit)
Out of the mist, there's a priest
(From a man with a joint in his hand)
Out of the mist (I kissed you beautiful)

Out of the mist
How could I miss you with your drugs?
Out of the mist
How could I miss you with your druggy ways? (fuck off)
Out of the mist (out of the misty world i spun my dreams)
Out of the mist
Out of the mist (I pissed on Gordon Lightfoot twice)
I kissed your lovely drug-filled lips

You sleazy prostitute
Where's your pimp friend?
(Gimmie your fucking can of 'ludes turn 'em over whore)
Where's your pimp friend and your priest?
As he stood there and lectured to me
On how i should live about (on his yeast infection)
(Fucking priest with a yeast infection)
A drug problem that never existed

Out of the mist
I kissed your drug-filled lips
